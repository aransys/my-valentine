# Be My Valentine — Growing Heart

A minimal Valentine’s experience: a small heart grows with every click until the question appears. No puzzles, no escape room—just one heart and one question.

## How it works

1. **Click the heart** — Each click makes it grow and shows short messages (“It’s growing…”, “You’re making my heart race…”, etc.).
2. **At 15 clicks** — “Will you be my Valentine?” appears with **Yes** and **Maybe** (no No).
3. **Yes** — Success overlay and a burst of heart particles.
4. **Maybe** — First time: “That’s okay, take your time…” and the heart shrinks a little. Second time: “Click anywhere… let your heart decide…” — clicking anywhere on the page grows the heart again; after 20 background clicks it shows “I think that’s a yes… ❤️” and goes to success.

## Run it

Open `index.html` in a browser, or:

```bash
npx serve .
```

Works on desktop and mobile. Uses Cormorant Garamond, Karla, and a soft blush/rose palette (see `valentines-proposal-plan.md` Concept 3).
