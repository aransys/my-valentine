# Ideas to Make It More Fun

## Already Implemented ✓
- **Haptic feedback** — Phone vibrates when tapping No
- **"No" counter** — Shows how many times they said No before caving
- **Throttled effects on mobile** — Fewer hearts/fireworks for smoother performance

## Fun Additions to Consider

### Sound
- **Optional celebration sound** — Play a short chime/cheer when they say Yes (with a mute toggle for public use)
- **Sound effects on No** — A playful "nope" or sad trombone when they tap the moving button

### Easter Eggs
- **Triple-tap on the heart** — Reveals a secret message or extra animation
- **Shake to undo** — If they said Yes by accident, shake the phone to go back
- **"Maybe" button** — Add a sneaky third button that does something silly (e.g., transforms into "Yes")

### Progression & Gamification
- **Unlockable messages** — After X "No"s, show a different persuasive message or joke
- **Difficulty levels** — "Easy" (No stays put) vs "Impossible" (No runs away faster each time)
- **Streak counter** — "You've resisted 7 times — impressive! But…"

### Sharing & Personalization
- **Share button** — "I said yes! 💕" with a link to the app or a screenshot
- **Custom name** — Let the sender type their name so it says "Will you be [Name]'s Valentine?"
- **Custom questions** — Allow the sender to edit the sweetQuestions array or add their own

### Visual Flourish
- **Confetti** — Add a burst of colorful confetti on Yes (in addition to hearts)
- **Animated capybara** — Make them blink, wave, or give a little hop on success
- **Parallax background** — Subtle movement when tilting the phone (if device orientation is available)
- **Dark mode** — Respect `prefers-color-scheme: dark` with a moody Valentine palette

### Playful No Behavior
- **Shake before run** — No button wiggles/jitters before it moves (like it's nervous)
- **Speed ramp** — No moves faster the more times they click
- **"Okay fine" moment** — After ~15 No's, show "Okay fine, I'll say Yes" and auto-accept with a joke
